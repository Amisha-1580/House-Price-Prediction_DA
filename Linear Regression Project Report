Project Title: Linear Data Prediction Using Linear Regression


ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning technique, to predict continuous values from a dataset.
It serves as a practical introduction to regression modeling, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation using Python libraries.


ðŸ“Š Objectives
Understand the relationship between input features and a target variable.

Build and train a linear regression model.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Visualize data and model predictions.


ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn


ðŸ”„ Workflow
Data Loading and Inspection

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Checked for null values and overall data structure.

Data Visualization

Used scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables.

Analyzed trends and outliers.

Model Building

Used LinearRegression from scikit-learn.

Trained the model on a split dataset (training/testing).

Prediction and Evaluation

Generated predictions on test data.

Evaluated using metrics like:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RÂ² Score

Visualization of Results

Plotted regression line alongside actual data to interpret model fit.


âœ… Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates a complete pipeline for applying linear regression to a dataset. 
The model provides a baseline for future regression work and can be expanded with more complex techniques like regularization or polynomial regression.
