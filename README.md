# ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** to predict continuous values  of ðŸš€Price Priduction for Houseâœ” from a dataset. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation â€” ideal for beginners learning supervised machine learning.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
- Checked for null or inconsistent values

### 2. Data Visualization
- Plotted feature-target relationships using `matplotlib`
- Analyzed data patterns and trends

### 3. Model Building
- Used `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`
- Split data into training and test sets
- Trained and fitted the model

### 4. Evaluation
- Evaluated performance using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - RÂ² Score
- Plotted regression line against actual data

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
The notebook builds a foundational understanding of linear regression and its implementation in Python. It can be expanded with polynomial regression, feature scaling, or regularization for more complex datasets.
